## Current state (update this block every pass)

**Phase:** Phase 23-A complete (2026-04-27). Unlock system infrastructure (no version bump — logic only). Next: 23-B — add new locked content (Deep Roots, Curator's Eye augments; Vrethix judge; Prestige Tag, Collector's Mark items).

**Phase 22 complete (2026-04-27):** Balance pass shipped (v0.32).
- **Livid dominance fixed:** Class mult ×1.10/×1.20 → ×1.08/×1.16. livid-stack: 69.3% → 63.3% (-6pp).
- **Giddy dead path fixed:** Class flat +18/+36 → +30/+72. giddy-stack: 37% → 41.7% (+4.7pp).
- **Crystalline dead path improved:** Species flat +18/+42/+78 → +28/+70/+110. crystalline-stack: 39.3% → 41.7% (+2.4pp).
- **Sharzak redesigned:** base 44→62; passive changed from sell bonus (+3g, 0 score) to '+14 per other Giddy specimen on board' (axis 2). Root cause of both dead paths — Sharzak was dead weight in all its builds.
- **Krombax buffed:** base 48→62. Crystalline T1 floor raised.
- **Cross-Pollination augment nerfed:** 8% → 6% per active synergy. Exploit delta: +13.7pp → +11pp.
- **Not changed:** Abyssal (×1.40/×1.90), AccliLog (20/round) — both tanked baseline when nerfed; deferred.
- **Balance sweep (n=300, seed=42):** greedy 56.7%, livid 63.3%, abyssal-sporal 67.7%, abyssal-stack 66.3%, giddy 41.7%, crystalline 41.7%, blinxorp-max 79% (up from 74% — proportional to baseline shift; cap fix still in place).
- **Exploit sweep:** AccliLog +22.3pp (accepted), Cross-Pollination +11pp, Taxonomy Badge: Abyssal +14.7pp.

**Phase 19-F complete (2026-04-26):** Sim calibration — retuned ROUND_TARGETS (v0.26).
- Greedy survival: 18.7% → 54.8% on Standard (spec: ~55-65%). Avg lives lost: 1.64 (spec: 1-3).
- Tier scaling: Discerning ×1.25 → 23.0%, Elite ×1.5 → 5.4% — meaningful progression confirmed.
- Root cause of original failure: R1 target (150) matched the median score — 66% miss rate on Round 1 alone; R16-R24 targets (3100-7000) were 40-82% miss rates.
- New curve: R1=100, R2=135, R3=200, R4-R15 unchanged (R4=400…R15=2600), R16=2800 (Critique 2), R17=3000, R18=3100, R19=3450, R20=3700, R21=3700, R22=3700, R23=3900, R24=4600 (Grand Finale). All preferred targets = base × 0.85.
- Per-round miss rates: R1-R20 averaging 8-17%; R21-R23 effectively 3-7% (judge qualification suppresses late-chapter miss rates — intended reward for committed builds); R24 ~30%.
- Balance sweep (500 seeds): greedy 54.8%, wide 52.8%, abyssal-stack 65.6%, livid-stack 71.0% (strong but historically in range). blinxorp-max 81.8% remains the known Growth Serum cap-bypass ceiling (deferred).
- sim.js: runGame() accepts opts.diffMult (passed to Run constructor).
- run.js: play/sim commands updated to use battleHistory (opponentHistory was removed Phase 19-A). sim shows lives distribution.

**Phase 20-A complete (2026-04-26):** Exploit sweep shipped (v0.27).
- `sweepAugments(n, seed)` in `src/balance.js`: force-picks each augment at R3, AI picks R7+R12. Reports survival delta vs greedy baseline. Flags anything >8pp above baseline.
- `sweepItems(n, seed)`: force-picks each item at every item round (R5/R10/R15 = 3 copies spread across board). Reports survival delta. Same flag threshold.
- `resolveItemPick(run, forceItemId)` in `src/sim.js`: new param injects a specific item into the offer before pick.
- `runGame` passes `opts.forceItem` through to `resolveItemPick`.
- `node run.js exploit [n] [seed]` CLI command prints both sweep tables.
- Smoke test at n=20 flagged: Acclimatisation Log (+40pp), Pheromone Diffuser (+30pp), Rarity Certificate (+20pp), Taxonomy Badge: Abyssal (+15pp), Acclimatisation Program augment (+10pp), Cross-Pollination augment (+10pp). Run at n=200+ for reliable results.

**Phase 20-B complete (2026-04-26):** Economy investigation (v0.27 — no version bump, sim-only).
- `economy-stack` policy added to `src/sim.js`: biases toward Axis-7 cards (Sporvik, Sharzak) + sets `_augmentBias = ['Tycoon', 'MidasTouch']`.
- `economy-max` build added to `BUILDS` in `src/balance.js`: forced Tycoon@R3 + MidasTouch@R12 + Market Tag every item round.
- Result: `economy-stack` 33.7%, `economy-max` 6.3% — both well below greedy 57.3%. **Economy is NOT broken.**
- Root cause of user's "double interest feels strong": Axis-7 cards score nearly nothing (Sporvik baseScore=52, Sharzak=44); gold compounds but you've already lost lives before it helps. The psychological effect of watching gold tick up is real; the actual impact isn't.
- "Double interest" = Tycoon augment doubling the interest component of earnIncome. Correctly modelled in sim. Not a balance problem.
- Full sweep (n=300) key findings: livid-stack 71.0% (+14pp vs greedy), abyssal-sporal 66.7%, abyssal-stack 64.0%, blinxorp-max 79.7% (known ceiling). Dead paths confirmed: crystalline-stack 40.7%, giddy-stack 35.7% (−17–21pp vs greedy).

**Phase 20-C complete (2026-04-26):** Playtest 3 UX fixes (v0.28).
- Judge panel: when qualifying, now shows "✓ 2+ Abyssal active → Target: 680" instead of just "✓ Target: 680" — requirement stays visible alongside the confirmed bonus.
- Shen-Nax excluded from Chapter 1 judge pool: `_assignJudges()` draws Ch1 from a filtered pool (all judges except shen_nax); Ch2/Ch3 draw from full remainder. Shen-Nax's "2+ T3 active" condition is near-impossible in rounds 1–8.

**Phase 20-B addendum (2026-04-26):** Smart-greedy policy shipped (v0.29).
- `smart-greedy` policy added to `src/sim.js`: saves gold when current board score already clears the next chapter critique target (R8/R16/R24). Plinths still bought regardless (levelling improves future shop odds). Card buying resumes when score is below the critique target.
- `boardScore(player, round, run)` helper computes live board score inside the policy.
- `runGame` now passes `run` as third arg to policy (ignored by all existing policies).
- Survival: smart-greedy 54.7% vs greedy 56.7% — 2pp gap is the legitimate cost of conservative saving. Per-round pass rate nearly identical (90.2% vs 90.3%), confirming the policy isn't weaker per round, just slightly more conservative overall.
- T3 early-game penalty tested but removed: a flat -20 penalty caused smart-greedy to skip genuinely good T3 cards, driving survival to 51%. The correct implementation would require synergy-context awareness (only skip T3 if it doesn't complete a threshold) — deferred.
- Extra reroll (+1) tested and removed: added cost without offsetting benefit at current reroll cap (2g per attempt absorbed savings advantage).

**Phase 20-D complete (2026-04-26):** Balance pass shipped (v0.30).
- **Growth Serum cap bypass fixed:** Blinxorp and Scrithnab passives now expose a `cap` property. `board.js` Stage 1 applies the cap *after* item wrapping — Growth Serum doubles the per-round rate but not the ceiling. Blinxorp cap lowered 400→300.
- **Blinxorp-max:** 79.7% → 74.0% (−5.7pp). Remaining ceiling is from forced TimeDilation+abyssal combo; the cap exploit is eliminated.
- **Giddy dead path fixed:** Giddy-3 flat 22→36, Giddy-2 flat 10→18. giddy-stack: 35.0% → 37.0% (above floor).
- **Final balance (n=300, seed=42):** greedy 55.3%, livid-stack 69.3% (within ceiling), giddy 37.0%, crystalline 39.3% (both above floor). Forced-optimal builds: blinxorp-max 74%, fluxnob-max 73% — both require lucky augment+item alignment; all natural policies in range.
- **Cross-Pollination** tested at 7% (too aggressive, dropped greedy 2.6pp and hurt giddy); kept at 8%.
- **Acclimatisation Log** tested at 15/round (also too aggressive, hurt baseline ~5pp for no targeted-build benefit); kept at 20/round.

**Phase 21 complete (2026-04-27):** Polish & Clarity pass shipped (v0.31).
- **A — Rules modal fixed:** Removed stale "opponent/Rep" bullet. Replaced with two correct bullets: "Each round your exhibit is judged against a target score — miss it and lose a Seal" + "Lose all 3 Seals and your run ends · Beat a Critique round by 25%+ to restore one".
- **B — Seal loss/regain feedback:** `sealLost` sound (harsh crack + downward sweep, distinct from `loss` melody) plays on every missed round. `sealRestored` sound (ascending bell chord) plays on life regain. CSS `@keyframes seal-shatter` animates the newly-lost seal diamond (flash gold→red→settle empty). Continue button delayed 500ms on life regain to hold the moment.
- **C — Score target in HUD sub-row:** `#target-preview` span added next to income preview; populated by `renderJudgePanel()`. Shows base target normally; turns green and reads "Target: N (preferred)" when judge preference is met.
- **D — Interest cap signal:** `renderIncomePreview()` now uses `innerHTML`; when raw interest is maxed (gold ≥ 25), adds amber `<span class="income-cap">✓ max</span>` inline with the interest figure.
- **E — Bench affordance hint:** Bench area desc updated to "· Reserve bench — won't score · Click to move to Exhibit".
- **F — Grand Finale overlay:** `showGrandFinaleReveal()` fires at `startRound()` when `nextRound === 24`. Reuses `.chapter-reveal` infrastructure with `.grand-finale-reveal` gold accent. `grandFinale` sound (dramatic low build + bright chord). Overlay reads "Round 24 / Grand Finale / All judges present · Final score".
- **G — Reroll cost on button:** Already implemented (line 927 of app.js). No change needed.

**Phase 23-A complete (2026-04-27):** Unlock system infrastructure (no version bump).
- **`src/achievements.js` created:** `ACHIEVEMENTS` (5 entries), `evaluateAchievements(run)`, `getUnlocks()`, `addUnlock()`, `isUnlocked()`. localStorage-backed; graceful no-op in Node.js so sim pools stay clean.
- **`run.stats` added to `Run`:** `maxClassSynergiesActive`, `maxCrystallineActive`, `allSpeciesRepresented`, `maxTripleStarsActive` — tracked each round in `runBattle()` after `calcScoreBreakdown()`.
- **Filtered pools:** `getAvailableAugments()` / `getAvailableItems()` exported from augments.js / items.js; `pendingAugment()`, `pendingItem()`, `pendingCurator()` all use filtered pools.
- **`_assignJudges()` updated:** filters `HEAD_JUDGES` by `!j.locked || isUnlocked(j.id)` — ready for Vrethix in 23-B.
- **Smoke test (n=50, seed=42):** all policies ran without errors; ordering preserved.

**Next action:** Phase 23-B — Add new locked content: Deep Roots + Curator's Eye to `src/augments.js`; Vrethix to `HEAD_JUDGES` in `src/game.js`; Prestige Tag + Collector's Mark to `src/items.js`. Run balance sweep to verify baseline unchanged with locked content excluded, then manually unlock all 5 and re-run to check exploit ceiling.

**Phase:** Phase 16 complete (2026-04-25). Sim-driven balance pass shipped (v0.18).

**Local dev fix (2026-04-25):** `serve.js` was rewriting `/` → serves `web/index.html` content while leaving the URL at `/`, so relative paths like `style.css` resolved against root and 404'd (broken since the GitHub Pages path-relativization). Fixed by serving root `index.html` (the meta-refresh page) at `/` — browser then navigates to `/web/index.html` and relative paths resolve. Local dev now matches GitHub Pages flow exactly.

**Phase 16 changes (2026-04-25):**
- C1: Blinxorp cap +400 (was uncapped; saturates at R16). `blinxorp-max` p50 7372→5624 (−24%), survival 59.2%→48.0%.
- C3: Abyssal-2 synergy mult ×1.60→×1.40 (4-count still ×1.90). `abyssal-stack` survival 31.4%→23.2%.
- C4: Livid-4 class mult ×1.28→×1.20, Livid-2 ×1.12→×1.10. `livid-stack` p50 3563→3263.
- C5-A: Plasmic-4 flat 48→58, Plasmic-2 flat 26→32. `plasmic-stack` p50 +40 (ceiling unchanged — hybrid splash runs lost Abyssal kicker, pure-Plasmic commits slightly stronger).
- C6: Giddy-3 flat 14→22, Giddy-2 flat 6→10. Marginal movement — class synergies are half-weight by calibration rule.
- C2 (Growth Serum × Accl. Program compounding): investigated, found non-issue. TimeDilation's +5/round is added as a separate pipeline stage (board.js line 239), not routed through card.passive.eval, so Growth Serum's wrapPassive does not double it. No fix needed.
- Infrastructure: `src/balance.js` (Monte Carlo harness), 10 species/class policies + `abyssal-sporal` mix in `src/sim.js`, `balance` command in `run.js` (committed in 6894096 before balance-pass changes).
- Version bumped to v0.18.
- Guardrail note: strict targets (blinxorp-max p50≤5000, surv≤40%) were not fully hit on C1 alone — original plan assumed C1+C2 both landing. 48% survival remains the gap; blinxorp/next-best ratio closed from 2.03×→1.68× which is the headline movement. Accepted pending playtest.


**GitHub Pages deployment (2026-04-22):**
- Deployed to https://bazzboyy1.github.io/auto-card-battles/
- Root `index.html` redirect added (`meta refresh → web/index.html`) — Pages can't deploy from a subfolder
- Fixed all absolute paths that broke under Pages subdirectory: `web/index.html` asset hrefs, `web/loader.js` src paths, `web/style.css` Splash.png references (all changed from `/…` to relative `../…` or `./…`)
- Bug fix: skip() in judging panel showed wrong totals — stale `requestAnimationFrame` callback fired after skip() set the correct value and overwrote it; fixed by tracking rAF handles in `rafs[]` and calling `rafs.forEach(cancelAnimationFrame)` in skip()
- Augment tooltip descriptions cleaned: "Axis N" parentheticals removed from four augment descriptions (Conditioning Protocol, Rapid Development, Early Bloomer, Market Savant)

**UX pass 3 (2026-04-21):**
- Game renamed: "Exotic Alien Extravaganza" → **Alien Exhibition** (title, browser tab, splash)
- Splash image now bleeds through as subtle board background (88% dark overlay on body)
- Splash/rules buttons renamed to "Play"; splash description updated to mention competing against other collectors' exhibitions
- How to Play popup added between splash and game — 6-bullet summary, shown once per session
- HUD tooltips: Rep, Gold, Exhibit Lvl now show explanatory tooltip on hover (drops below HUD bar)
- Upgrade Exhibit button now hosts the tier odds tooltip directly; standalone ⓘ info button removed
- New exhibit slot flashes yellow when Upgrade Exhibit is clicked
- Ready button disabled (greyed) when Exhibit is empty; native tooltip explains why
- "Effect" section header added above passive description in card tooltip
- Scoring continue button appears immediately when judging resolves (removed 800ms delay)
- Empty card slots more visible: brighter dashed border (#4d5566), opacity 0.65
- "Hover specimens to see their abilities" hint in Specimen Market header
- Area descriptions added: "Active specimens — score each round" / "Reserve bench — won't score"
- "Exhibits" label renamed to "Exhibit" (singular) throughout UI and rules popup
- Bug fix: `updateShopControls` and `updateHUD` used `textContent=` which destroyed child tooltip spans — fixed to save/re-append before overwriting

**UX pass 2 (2026-04-21):**
- Tooltip horizontal clamping: synergy badges, augment badges, item bag pills no longer overflow viewport edges
- Augment/item pick offers moved from side-panel modal into the shop bottom bar; attention toasts removed
- Button renamed: "Add Plinth" → "Upgrade Exhibit"; HUD level renamed "Lv N" → "Exhibit Lvl N"
- Added ⓘ info button next to Upgrade Exhibit showing per-level T1/T2/T3 shop odds table (originally labelled Common/Uncommon/Rare; renamed to match card tier terminology)
- Contextual descriptions added under "Choose an Augment" / "Choose an Item" headers
- Item offer titles now blue (#79c0ff) to distinguish from augment gold
- "Next income" label moved to centred sub-row beneath the top HUD header
- HUD left/right given flex:1 so Rep/Gold/Exhibit Lvl is truly centred
- Version bumped to v0.15

**Theme direction (locked 2026-04-20):** Player is an exotic alien collector competing in a judged exhibition (not combat). Creatures are deliberately ugly/strange aliens, played completely straight for irony. Score = collection appraisal / exhibition ranking. Species = alien biology type. Class = dominant emotion. See `design_log/theme_redesign.md` for full mapping.

**Theme rename pass (2026-04-20):**
- All 20 card names replaced with alien scientific names (Rick & Morty register, 2 syllables, -borg/-ax/-orb/-zak suffixes)
- Species renamed: Warrior→Plasmic, Mage→Sporal, Hunter→Chitinous, Beast→Crystalline, Demon→Abyssal
- Classes renamed: Knight→Shy, Assassin→Livid, Ranger→Giddy, Priest→Sullen, Berserker→Pompous
- Updated: src/cards.js, src/board.js, src/items.js, src/sim.js, web/app.js
- Fixed web/style.css species color classes (were still keyed to old names, cards showed no background color)
- Sim verified post-rename: greedy=71%, plasmic-stack=61% — math intact

**Item & augment rename (2026-04-20):**
- Items renamed: Claymore→Exhibition Stand, Recurve Bow→Growth Serum, Giant's Belt→Rarity Certificate, Warmog's Armor→Stimulant Pod, Zeke's Herald→Pheromone Diffuser, Hextech Gunblade→Market Tag, Last Whisper→Bloom Stimulant, Guinsoo's Rageblade→Acclimatisation Log, Spear of Shojin→Camouflage Gland
- Emblems renamed: `Emblem of [Species]` → `Taxonomy Badge: [Species]`; `Crest of [Class]` → `Mood Tag: [Class]` (ids unchanged)
- Augments renamed: Heroic Resolve→Prestige Display, Iron Will→Conditioning Protocol, Time Dilation→Acclimatisation Program, Exponential Growth→Rapid Development, Shapeshifter→Species Reclassification, Early Bird→Early Bloomer, Midas Touch→Market Savant, Hive Mind→Collective Resonance, Overflow→Extended Enclosure, Tycoon→Collector's Eye, Varietal→Diverse Portfolio, Cross-Training→Cross-Pollination
- Updated: src/items.js, src/augments.js, web/app.js (dev panel item dropdown was using id not name)
- All augment/item ids kept stable — only display names changed

**Concept:** Single-player roguelike Auto Chess. Draft cards, build species synergies, out-score fake opponents over 30 rounds. Cards have passive effects (8 axes), combine 3-of-a-kind to upgrade, equip items, pick augments at rounds 3/7/12. Start at L3 with 9g.

**Working pitch:** *"Auto-Card Battles: draft cards, build synergies, out-score your opponents. No combat — just the board, the math, and the meta."*

**Phase 9.2 sim results (2026-04-20):** 200-game batch, seed=1:

| Policy | Winrate | Avg rounds | Run survival | Target |
|--------|---------|------------|--------------|--------|
| greedy | 63.0% | 20.1 | 23.5% | 45–70% ✓ |
| wide | 62.4% | 20.4 | 24.0% | competitive ✓ |
| warrior-stack | 55.8% | 18.5 | 13.0% | ≤ greedy ✓ |

**Architecture as of Phase 9.2:**
- `src/cards.js` — 20 cards, 5 species, 5 classes, 3 tiers, 8 passive axes; SYNERGIES + CLASS_SYNERGIES
- `src/board.js` — scoring pipeline Stages 0–5 + 3b/4a-class; effectiveClassCounts + cardHasClassTag
- `src/items.js` — 15 items (10 + 5 class Crests); pre-processor wrappers for axis-mod items
- `src/augments.js` — 12 augments (incl. Varietal, CrossTraining), picked 1-of-3 at rounds 3/7/12
- `src/game.js` — `Player` + `Run`; 30-round roguelike vs fake opponents; L3/5g-income start
- `src/opponents.js` — fake opponent score curve tuned to 45–70% player winrate
- `src/sim.js` — `greedy` / `random` / `warrior-stack` / `demon-arc` / `wide` policies; `runGame` / `batchSim`
- `src/shop.js` — per-player weighted draw; reroll cost 2g (3g at L6+); Midas reduces by 1g
- `web/app.js` — browser UI; augment modal + Shapeshifter sub-modal; item bag + attach flow; opponent board viewer; dev panel (?dev=1)

**Run the game:** `node serve.js` → http://localhost:3001

**Phase 8.1 + 8.2 changes (2026-04-19):**
- A1: `onBuyShop` guards `isFull()` before `shop.buy()` — card no longer silently destroyed on full board
- A2: `_combine` captures `shapeshifterSpecies` before splicing source cards — tag survives combine
- A3: `renderSynergyBar` uses `effectiveSpeciesCounts` — Dragon Knight, Morphling, Emblems now display correctly
- B1: Augment badges use `<span class="aug-tooltip">` instead of `title` — styled hover tooltip
- B2: `mouseenter` toggles `.tooltip-below` when card is within 180px of viewport top — no more clipping
- B3: `Board.calcScoreBreakdown()` added; `calcScore` is now a thin wrapper; card faces show effective score + `(base N)` secondary; tooltip shows per-line breakdown
- Sim re-run post-refactor: 60.1% winrate (was 59.8%) — within noise, math intact

**Phase 8.3 changes (2026-04-19):**
- `src/game.js`: `player.itemBag = []`; `Run.itemPickRounds = [5,10,15]`; `Run.pendingItem()` / `pickItem()` — mirrors augment pick flow
- `src/sim.js`: `resolveItemPick()` — greedy picks first offered item, attaches to highest-EV unit with a free slot
- `web/app.js`: `'item'` phase; `showItemModal()` (mirrors augment modal); `renderItemBag()` inventory panel with click-to-attach / click-again-to-cancel; universal pip detach returns to bag; `onCardClick` handles attach mode; `.attach-target` highlight on eligible cards
- `web/style.css`: item bag panel, attach-target card border, detachable pip cursor/hover
- Sim re-run post-phase: 69.1% winrate (was 60.1%) — items boost player, still within 45–70% target

**Playtest 2 complete (2026-04-20).** Feedback collected; full findings + Phase 9 plan in `design_log/playtest_2_findings.md`. Headline: no pivot pressure in current design — Warrior mono-builds dominate, 3-stars too easy, economy loose. Decision: solve structurally (add class tag as second synergy axis) + balance (economy tighten, synergy rebalance, diversity augments). Rejected simulated pool drain — no signal value without drafting opponents.

**Phase 9.1 changes (2026-04-20):**
- A1: `makeItemTooltip(item)` helper — styled tooltip (name + axis + description) shared by bag pills and equipped pips; pips get `position: relative`; removed native `title` attribute fallback
- A2: `renderAugmentBadges` switched to DOM building; `mouseenter` toggles `.tooltip-left` when badge + 240px would overflow right edge; `.aug-tooltip` now `max-width: 240px` + `word-wrap: break-word`
- A3: `generateOpponentSnapshot(round, opponentName)` in `web/app.js` (separate seeded RNG — no effect on gameplay RNG); `onReady()` attaches snapshot to result; toggle button + `.opp-board` section in result modal; `'viewer'` context added to `makeCard` (no pips, no click handlers)

**Phase 9.2 changes (2026-04-20):**
- B1: `BASE_INCOME` 7 → 5; reroll cost scales to 3g at L6+ (2g with MidasTouch). Greedy sim: 63.0% winrate (was 63.0% — within noise; run survival 27% → 23.5%).
- B2: Synergy rebalance — Warrior-4 flat 65→48, Warrior-2 22→26; Hunter-3 45→40, Hunter-2 18→22; Beast-6 85→78, Beast-4 38→42, Beast-2 14→18; Mage-4 ×1.30→×1.27, Mage-2 ×1.14→×1.17; Demon-4 ×2.2→×1.90, Demon-2 ×1.8→×1.60. Greedy: 61.2%, warrior-stack: 53.2%.
- B3: Added `Varietal` augment (+8 flat/card per unique active species) and `CrossTraining` augment (+8% global mult per active synergy). Added `wide` policy to sim. Post-B3: greedy=63.0%, wide=62.4%, warrior-stack=55.8%. Diversity builds now competitive with greedy; mono-Warrior lags 7+ pp behind.

**Phase 9.3 changes (2026-04-20):**
- C1: `class` field added to all 20 cards (5 classes × 4 cards, each class spans 3–4 species). `CLASS_SYNERGIES` + `CLASSES` exported from `src/cards.js`. 5 class emblem items (`Crest of [Class]`, axis `5-class`) added to `src/items.js`.
- C2: `effectiveClassCounts()` + `cardHasClassTag()` in `src/board.js`. Class synergy stages added to `calcScoreBreakdown` pipeline (3b: class flats after species flats; 4a-class: class mults after species mults). `CrossTraining` augment now counts both species and class active synergies. `activeSynergies()` returns both kinds.
- C3: `renderSynergyBar` shows two rows (species gold, class blue). Card face shows `<span class="card-class">`. `makeSynergyTooltip` includes class synergy threshold section. `itemAbbrev` handles `Crest of`.
- C4: Sim-tuned CLASS_SYNERGIES values (initial values ~3× too high; iterated to final). Greedy=70.4%, wide=69.2%, warrior-stack=63.5%. All within/at 45–70% target; ordering correct.

**Phase 9.3 sim results (2026-04-20):** 200-game batch, seed=1:

| Policy | Winrate | Run survival | vs Phase 9.2 |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| greedy | 70.4% | 36.0% | +7.4pp ✓ |
| wide | 69.2% | 35.0% | +6.8pp ✓ |
| warrior-stack | 63.5% | 23.0% | +7.7pp ✓ |

Class synergy values (final):
- Knight (flat/class): 2→+8, 4→+16
- Assassin (mult/class): 2→×1.12, 4→×1.28
- Ranger (flat/class): 2→+6, 3→+14
- Priest (mult/all): 2→×1.02, 4→×1.05
- Berserker (mult/class): 2→×1.13, 4→×1.30

**Phase 10 complete (2026-04-20):** Card layout fix, axis labels removed, synergy wording + syn-bar tooltips, Exhibition Floor/Holding Pen/Rep relabels, side-panel modal during augment/item picks, class glyphs (◌◆◈▪▲).

**Phase 11 complete (2026-04-20):** Battle scoring animation + rank-up throb. New `'scoring'` phase replaces `'result'` entirely. Flow: shop → Ready → scoring → Continue → shop (or game-over).
- `allocateByWeight` + `calcOpponentPerCardScores`: scores fabricated proportionally, player side normalized to sum to `r.playerScore`
- Two-column judging modal (Your Exhibition | Opponent Exhibition); cards never stretch when columns are unequal height (`align-items: flex-start`)
- `animateScoringSequence`: card punch (scale 1→1.18→0.95→1, 280ms), score fades in at 120ms, `+N` delta floats up from running total (600ms opacity+translate), 600ms inter-phase gap, winner reveal holds 800ms; skip() cancels all timeouts and snaps to final state
- `showResultModal` deleted; `'result'` phase removed
- Rank-up throb: `data-card-id` on all card elements; `runCombinesWithEffect()` detects newly combined cards (new `_id`, `stars > 1`); `animateRankUps()` adds `.throbbing` (double golden pulse glow, 650ms); wired into `onBuyShop` and `onCardClick`
- Files: `web/app.js`, `web/style.css`

**Phase 12-A complete (2026-04-21):** Board total hidden; "Exhibition Floor" renamed to "Exhibits".
- Removed `#score-preview` span from `web/index.html` board section header — players no longer see the running total during shop/prep phase
- Removed `qs('#score-preview').textContent` update line from `web/app.js` `updateHUD()`; `calcScoreBreakdown` + `bdMap` retained (still needed for per-card tooltip breakdowns)
- Renamed area label "Exhibition Floor" → "Exhibits" in `web/index.html`
- Design rationale: aggregate total is now only revealed during the judging animation (first dramatic moment); per-card scores, synergy bars, and tooltip breakdowns remain fully visible so buying decisions are unaffected. Practical opacity: players *can* add up per-card scores but won't casually, so tension is preserved without punishing information hiding.
- Files: `web/index.html`, `web/app.js`

**Phase 12-B complete (2026-04-21):** Repo made public for external playtesting.
- Repo is public on GitHub at `https://github.com/bazzboyy1/auto-card-battles`
- (Historical note: an earlier draft of this entry referenced Netlify; we never actually deployed there. `netlify.toml` is leftover and unused — safe to delete.)

**Post-deploy playtest findings (2026-04-21):** Full analysis in `design_log/phase_13_plan.md`.
- BUG: Animation per-card scores differ from Exhibits card-face scores — root cause: `roundsSinceBought` is incremented after `calcScore()` in `runBattle()`, but animation re-computes breakdown post-increment
- BUG: Species + class tag ("Sporal ◌SHY") crowd onto same line — CSS layout fix needed
- BUG: `_combine()` resets `roundsSinceBought` to 0 — Growth Serum and Acclimatisation Log lose all accumulated rounds on upgrade
- UX: Augment/item pick in RHS panel goes unnoticed — need attention toast
- DESIGN (keep): Growth Serum retroactive application on attach is intentional — high-impact moment, felt good

**Polish pass (2026-04-21):**
- Game renamed to **Exotic Alien Extravaganza** (`<title>` + splash h1)
- Splash screen added: `Splash.png` full-bleed background, gradient overlay, pitch copy, "Enter Exhibition →" button; game initialises on load, reveals on button click
- Pitch copy: *"The finest collectors in the universe display their specimens before the galaxy's most discerning judges. Build your exhibition. Protect your reputation. Try not to embarrass yourself."*
- v0.12 version label added to HUD right (dim, small)
- Flavor text added to all 20 cards (`flavor` field in `src/cards.js`); rendered italic + dimmed in tooltip below passive description (`web/app.js`, `web/style.css`)
- Flavor text written in plural/sub-species register ("Sporviks continuously weep..." not "Sporvik weeps...")
- Deploy fix: `Splash.png` was not committed and CSS path was wrong case (`/splash.png` → `/Splash.png`)

**Phase 13 complete (2026-04-21):** Post-deploy bug fixes.
- A1: `runBattle()` now calls `calcScoreBreakdown(ctx)` before the `roundsSinceBought` tick and stores it as `scoreBreakdown` in the result entry. `showScoringModal()` uses the stored snapshot — animation scores now match card-face scores exactly.
- A2: `_combine()` captures `Math.max(...source.roundsSinceBought)` before splicing source cards and assigns it to the upgraded card — Growth Serum and Acclimatisation Log no longer lose accumulated rounds on upgrade.
- A3: `.card-labels` switched from `flex-wrap: wrap` row to `flex-direction: column` — species and class badges always stack vertically, no crowding even for longest names.
- A4: `showAttentionToast()` added; called when entering `'augment'` or `'item'` phase — center-screen banner ("Choose a Collector Upgrade →" / "Item Pick Ready →") fades in/out over 1.5s.
- Sim re-run post-A1+A2: greedy=73.7%, wide=71.8%, warrior-stack=66.5% (ordering preserved, within noise of ±3pp from 70.4%).

**Phase 14 complete (2026-04-21):** UX discoverability pass — four intuition fixes from post-deploy feedback.
- "Buy XP" replaced with **Add Plinth**: XP accumulation removed; direct slot purchase at tiered cost (8/8/12/20/24/28g L3→L9); button label updates dynamically; tooltip "Larger exhibitions attract rarer specimens" explains pool-tier side-effect. `#hud-xp` span removed.
- **Pip × badge**: filled item pips always show a small red × overlay (0.55 opacity), scales to full on hover — makes unequip affordance discoverable without changing the existing click-to-detach mechanic.
- **Always-visible synergy bar**: all 10 synergy rows (5 species + 5 class) rendered from round 1 at 0.4 opacity when inactive; threshold tooltips accessible immediately via hover. Previously only rows with count > 0 appeared.
- **Owned-copy counter on shop cards**: shows "You own ×N" on cards you already hold; shows pulsing gold "★ Upgrade! (you have 2)" banner when buying would trigger a combine. Teaches the 3-of-a-kind rule implicitly.
- **Sell returns items**: `Player.sell()` now pushes all `card.items` back to `itemBag` before removing the card.
- Files: `src/game.js`, `src/sim.js`, `src/diag.js`, `web/app.js`, `web/index.html`, `web/style.css`

**Polish (2026-04-21, post-UX-pass-2):** "Shop" renamed to "Specimen Market" throughout UI (section label, phase tag, lock button). T1/T2/T3 used in Upgrade Exhibit odds tooltip instead of Com./Unc./Rare.

**Phase 15 complete (2026-04-24):**
- A1: Opponent curve raised ~40% from R5 onward (R30 cap 3840→5535); accepts `rankMult` param
- A3: `title` tooltip on card-tier div clarifies T1/T2/T3 = pool rarity vs ★ = combine level
- R1–R4: `src/ranking.js` — 5 tiers (Enthusiast→Luminary), 3-run placement, RP system (win=30+rep×0.7, loss=−40, promote@200, demote<0 land@100), localStorage persistence under key `alien-exhibition-meta`
- `Run.rankMult` wired into `generateOpponent` — opponent difficulty scales with rank
- HUD shows "Calibration N/3" during placement, then tier name + RP/200 bar
- Run-complete modal shows RP change, promotion/demotion message, progress bar
- Version bumped to v0.17

**Phase 17 complete (2026-04-25):** Planning-phase bonus animations (v0.19).
- Score delta floaters (`+N`/`-N`) appear on board cards whenever a score changes during the shop phase: buy (synergy activates), sell (synergy breaks), bench↔active moves, item attach/detach, augment pick.
- Green (`#7ee787`) for gains, red (`#f85149`) for losses. Floats upward over 750ms and self-removes.
- Card glow flash (green/red ring) accompanies each delta — affected units are visually obvious at a glance.
- Synergy badge gold pulse (`syn-pulse`) fires when a species or class tier threshold is newly crossed.
- Augment badge green pulse (`augment-badge-pulse`) + staggered card sweep (`card-bonus-flash`, 60ms between cards) when an augment is picked — badge lights first, then cards catch the glow left-to-right, creating a clear source→target association.
- `data-synergy-key` added to all synergy badges; `data-aug-id` added to augment badges so animations can target them post-render.
- Economy/structural augments (Overflow, Tycoon, Shapeshifter) excluded from card sweep — no misleading "your scores changed" signal.
- New helpers: `captureScores()`, `captureSynergyTiers()`, `floatDelta()`, `animatePlanningDeltas()`, `animateSynergyChanges()`, `flashAugmentEffect()`.
- Files: `web/app.js`, `web/style.css`, `web/index.html`.

**Phase 18 complete (2026-04-25):** Flat + ×mult display on card face (v0.20).
- Active board cards now show additive flat and multiplicative factor separately (e.g. `76 ×1.02`) instead of the combined final score.
- Mult value styled orange (`#ffa657`) — same colour as mult lines in the existing tooltip breakdown, so the visual language is consistent.
- Cards with no active mult (≤ 1.001) show plain flat only — no ×1.0 clutter.
- Bench and shop cards unchanged: plain base score (no breakdown object passed).
- No changes to `src/board.js` — derived from existing `bd.lines` in `makeCard()` via sum of `add` entries / product of `mult` entries.
- Judging animation unchanged — still shows final allocated per-card scores.
- Files: `web/app.js`, `web/style.css`, `web/index.html`.

**Item & augment audit (2026-04-25):**
- Full audit of all 20 items and 12 augments — every effect verified in the node engine.
- **Fixed (v0.20.1):** Squorble card face showed flat (135) in rounds 1–9 instead of flat + penalty mult (135 ×0.50). Phase 18 display condition `multTotal > 1.001` never fired for mults < 1. Fixed to `Math.abs(multTotal - 1) > 0.001` in `web/app.js makeCard()`.
- **Known issue — Growth Serum breaks Blinxorp/Scrithnab cap:** Blinxorp's "max +400" cap is inside its eval; `wrapPassive` doubles the result *after* the cap, so Growth Serum yields effective max +800. This silently undoes the Phase 16 balance fix. Fix requires deciding whether to clamp the doubled result or restructure the cap out of the eval. **Deferred.**
- **Known edge cases (not bugs, no action yet):**
  - Prestige Display (+25 base) is skipped on Sprangus because `baseOverride: 0` bypasses the Stage 0 item/augment path.
  - Acclimatisation Log bypasses Sprangus's "scores 0" design (Stage 1 adds +20/round after the baseOverride, giving Sprangus real score).
  - Market Savant is economy-only (doubles Sporvik tickGold, Sharzak sellBonus, -1g reroll) — no effect visible in score breakdown tooltip; players may think it's broken.
  - Spear of Shojin species contribution invisible in synergy bar (preview skips player RNG — documented).
  - Items on wrong-axis cards (e.g. Growth Serum on axis-2 card) silently do nothing.

**Phase 19-B complete (2026-04-26):** Judges + chapters shipped (v0.22).
- `HEAD_JUDGES` array (6 judges) in `src/game.js`; `Run._assignJudges()` draws 3 without repeats using run RNG
- `Run.chapterFor(round)` / `Run.currentJudge(round)` helpers; chapter boundaries at R1/R9/R17
- `ROUND_TARGETS` extended with `preferredTarget` (base × 0.85, rounded) per round
- `Run.runBattle()` checks `judge.qualifies(board, augments)` before each battle; uses `preferredTarget` when qualifying
- `effectiveClassCounts` + `CLASS_SYNERGIES` imported into game.js for Yorzal's class-synergy check
- Judge panel rendered below income-preview HUD bar: shows chapter label, judge name, preference text, qualifying status (green "✓ Preferred (−15% target)" vs neutral hint)
- Panel updates live as board changes (called from every render branch)
- Chapter reveal overlay on R1/R9/R17: slides in over 2.2s then fades out
- Scoring modal heading includes judge name ("Round N — Judge Vlorb"); shows green "✓ Preferred (−15% applied)" note when qualifying
- Battle history entry extended: `normalTarget`, `preferredTarget`, `judgeId`, `qualified`
- Game-over round history shows "✓pref" badge on rounds where player qualified
- `HEAD_JUDGES`, `CHAPTER_LABELS` exported from game.js, available via `window.ACB.game`
- Browser-verified: judge panel visible R1, scoring modal shows judge name, no JS errors

**Phase 19-A complete (2026-04-26):** Core swap shipped (v0.21).
- Removed `src/opponents.js` dependency from game.js, sim.js, loader.js
- `ROUND_CAP` 30 → 24; `STARTING_LIVES = 3` added to Run
- `ROUND_TARGETS[24]` array in game.js: each entry `{ target, isCritique }` — critiques at R8/R16/R24
- `Run.runBattle()` now compares playerScore vs target; decrements `run.lives` on miss; tracks `run.peakScore`
- `Player.applyResult(passed)` simplified: no HP damage, still tracks streak/wins/losses (streak drives income bonus)
- `Run.isOver()` → `lives === 0 || round >= 24`
- `src/ranking.js` replaced: Exhibition Rating = (round × 100) + (lives × 200) + (peak/10); localStorage key `alien-exhibition-best`; `recordRun()` returns `{ rating, best, isNewBest }`
- HUD: HP span replaced with 3 seal diamonds (`◆` filled / `◇` empty via CSS); `#hud-rank` removed
- Scoring modal: two-column opponent → single player column + "Judge's Target" number on right; result shows "Target met / Target missed · Seal lost · N seals remain"
- Run-end modal: Exhibition Rating block + Round History table; no RP/placement text
- `src/sim.js`: `battleHistory` replaces `opponentHistory`; `survived = round >= 24`; `livesRemaining` in result
- `src/balance.js`: updated to use `battleHistory`
- Browser-verified: lives decrement correctly, scoring modal shows target, run-end shows rating and history

**Phase 19-C complete (2026-04-26):** Critique rounds shipped (v0.23).
- `CURATOR_SELECTIONS` in `src/game.js`: one themed item/augment per judge (Vlorb→Taxonomy Badge: Abyssal, Praxis→Acclimatisation Log, Shen-Nax→Rarity Certificate, Yorzal→Cross-Pollination augment, Collective→Diverse Portfolio augment, Assembly→3-choice free augment pick)
- Life-regain: beat a critique target by 25%+ while lives < 3 → `run.lives++`, `lifeGained: true` in battle entry
- `Run.pendingCurator()` / `Run.pickCurator(idx)`: checks last battle was a critique, returns cached offer; `_curatorsPicked` prevents double-pick
- Scoring modal: adds `.critique-round` class on `#modal` for gold border/heading; life-regain shows "◆ Seal restored!" badge with pop animation
- `onContinue()` checks `pendingCurator()` before `startRound()` → enters `'curator'` phase
- Curator phase renders in shop-section with `renderCuratorOffer()`: single-gift card for most judges, 3-choice augment-card row for The Assembly; clicking accepts the gift and calls `startRound()` (which fires chapter reveal for R9/R17 after the gift)
- Judge panel visibility fix (from feedback): shows concrete target numbers — "2+ Abyssal active → 800 (680 if met)" when not qualifying, "✓ Target: 680" when qualifying; critique rounds show "★ Critique" tag
- The Assembly neutral text changed from "No bonus" to "All equally scored · Target: N"
- Shapeshifter filtered from Assembly's augment-pick pool to avoid nested sub-picks

**Phase 19-D complete (2026-04-26):** Build archetypes shipped (v0.24).
- `detectArchetypes()` in `web/app.js`: checks live board each render; 8 archetypes — Plasma Cascade (4+ Plasmic), Void Assembly (4+ Abyssal), Spore Engine (Sprangus + 2+ other Sporal), Crystal Lattice (4+ Crystalline), Chitin Wall (3+ Chitinous), Emotional Spectrum (3+ class synergies active), Patient Collection (3+ cards held 10+ rounds), Star Collector (2+ 3★ active)
- `updateArchetypeDisplay()`: tracks `S.archetypeOrder` — newly active archetypes prepend so most-recently-triggered shows prominently; stale ones drop off
- `#archetype-display` strip below judge panel: primary archetype in purple pill badge + `archetype-appear` pop animation when first triggered; secondary archetypes in smaller dimmer pills beside it; hidden when no archetypes active
- Reset on `newGame()`; called from `renderBoard()` so updates on every board change

**Phase 19-E complete (2026-04-26):** Difficulty tiers + meta-progression (v0.25).
- `TIERS` array in `src/ranking.js`: Standard (×1.0), Discerning Judges (×1.25), Elite Circuit (×1.5)
- Tier state persisted in localStorage under `alien-exhibition-tiers`; `getActiveTier`, `tryUnlockNextTier`, `setActiveTier` exported
- `Run` constructor accepts `diffMult`; targets in `runBattle()` scaled via `Math.round(base * diffMult)` — all other systems unchanged
- `renderDifficultyPicker(containerEl)` renders pill buttons into any host; shown on splash (`#difficulty-selector`) and in the game-over modal (`#modal-diff-picker`)
- `newGame()` reads active tier and passes its mult to `new Run(rng, tier.mult)`
- `showGameOverModal()` calls `tryUnlockNextTier` on a 24-round clear; shows green unlock banner + refreshed picker
- HUD right shows `#hud-difficulty` with current tier label (amber for Discerning, red for Elite)
- Locked tiers show 🔒 prefix + disabled button with unlock-hint tooltip
- Browser-verified: selector renders on splash, HUD shows "STANDARD", no JS errors

**Next action:** Phase 19 complete. Decide next: (a) Playtest 3 — ship to external players, collect feedback; (b) Phase 20 balance — address livid-stack dominance (71% vs greedy 55%), crystalline/giddy dead-path risk (36-39%), and Growth Serum cap-bypass on Blinxorp; (c) both in parallel.

**Open items (not yet spec'd):**
- Shapeshifter + class interaction (deferred to playtest 3)
- Drafting opponents (would unlock real pool drain + archetype signals; deferred post-Phase 9)
- Board positions for Axis 6 aura effects
- Leaderboard / persistence / real async matchmaking

## Hard reminders (never lose these)

- **Cards are data, not code.** New cards go in `src/cards.js` data section. Only add new effect logic if the scoring formula can't express it.
- **Headless first, GUI only at escalation milestones.** Runtime self-testing > GUI tinkering.
- **Log is the source of truth.** If memory or chat contradicts the log, trust the log. Update the log before moving on from a pass.
- **Sim-first.** Build batch runner before touching UI. Tune with data, not feel.
- **Don't over-tune early.** Card balance is polish. Get the loop working first.
- **Carry from Flipside:** same phased process — headless → economy tuning → UI → polish.
